# Resume Building Process

A repeatable process for building a comprehensive, evidence-based resume.

## The Core Insight

The best resume details come from **documented evidence** of your work, not just memory. Your memory tells you *what you did*; your documents show *what you actually accomplished*.

---

## 1. Start with Your Profile

- Pull your LinkedIn data (titles, dates, descriptions)
- Gather any existing resume versions
- Note gaps or vague descriptions to investigate

---

## 2. Identify Your Evidence Sources

What documented work can you point to?

| If you're a... | Look at... |
|----------------|------------|
| Engineer | Git repos, technical docs, architecture diagrams |
| Product Manager | PRDs, roadmaps, launch announcements, metrics dashboards |
| Marketer | Campaign reports, content you published, analytics |
| Designer | Portfolio, case studies, design systems, shipped products |
| Salesperson | CRM data, closed deals, presentations, quota attainment |
| Researcher | Papers, patents, conference talks, grant proposals |
| Manager | Team growth, performance reviews you wrote, org changes |
| Anyone | Calendar history, email threads, project docs, reviews |

---

## 3. Mine Each Source

For each evidence source:

**Git Repositories:**
- `git log --author="YourName" --since="YYYY-MM-01"` for commits
- README files for project context
- Package files for tech stack
- Pipeline configs for DevOps experience

**Documents:**
- Reports and proposals you authored
- Presentations you delivered
- Strategies you defined

**Published Work:**
- Articles, blog posts, whitepapers
- Patents or academic papers
- Open source contributions
- Conference talks or podcasts

**Project Tools:**
- Completed tickets and initiatives
- Projects you led or owned
- Cross-functional work

**Calendar:**
- Recurring meetings you ran
- Project kickoffs and launches
- Leadership patterns

---

## 4. Interview Yourself

For each major accomplishment, answer:

1. What was the **situation or challenge**?
2. What **actions** did you take?
3. What were the **results or impact**?
4. What **skills** did this demonstrate?
5. Can you **quantify** the outcome?
6. Was this **solo work or team collaboration**?

---

## 5. Iterate with Corrections

Your first draft will have gaps:
- Add business context that isn't in the docs
- Clarify scope and ownership
- Correct assumptions about impact
- Note what's complete vs. in progress

---

## 6. Structure the Resume

### Framing Techniques
- **SAR format** — Situation, Action, Result
- **Evolution sections** — Show growth over time
- **Pioneering language** — Where you were first
- **Metrics** — Quantify wherever possible

### Detail Levels
- **Master version** — Full detail with all context (for your reference)
- **Application version** — 1-2 pages, tailored to opportunity
- **Verbal version** — Key talking points for interviews

---

## 7. Keep It Current

Set a recurring reminder to:
- Update after major project completions
- Add new roles within a week of starting
- Refresh before any job search
- Mine new evidence sources quarterly

---

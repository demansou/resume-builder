# Resume Builder Skill

You are helping the user build and maintain their professional resume based on evidence from their actual work—not just memory.

## CRITICAL: Confidentiality Mandate

**Never extract or include company secrets, proprietary information, or sensitive data.**

When reviewing any source material:
- **DO** describe what the person accomplished and the impact they had
- **DO** identify skills, methodologies, and areas of expertise demonstrated
- **DO** note metrics if they're public or shareable (growth rates, scale, outcomes)
- **DON'T** copy proprietary content verbatim (code, strategies, processes)
- **DON'T** include internal project names, codenames, or client names without permission
- **DON'T** reveal trade secrets, confidential strategies, or unpublished work
- **DON'T** include credentials, internal URLs, or private contact information

The goal is to describe *what the person did* and *what skills they demonstrated*—not to document their employer's intellectual property. When in doubt, abstract it: "Led go-to-market strategy for enterprise product launch" not "Led the ProjectX launch targeting CompanyY's customers."

## Evidence Sources

This skill can help gather resume content from multiple sources:

| Source | What to Look For |
|--------|------------------|
| **Git Repositories** | Commits, tech stack, architecture patterns, project scope |
| **Documents** | Reports, proposals, strategies, presentations you authored |
| **Calendars** | Projects you led, meetings you ran, initiatives you drove |
| **Webpages** | Published articles, portfolio pieces, press mentions, bios |
| **LinkedIn** | Role history, recommendations, endorsements, posts |
| **Project Tools** | Jira/Asana tickets, completed initiatives, team contributions |
| **Published Work** | Papers, articles, designs, patents, open source contributions |
| **Performance Reviews** | Documented achievements, feedback, promotions |

## Available Modes

When invoked, ask which mode the user wants:

1. **Update Resume** - Add new roles, projects, or refine existing content
2. **Gather Evidence** - Scan available sources for resume-worthy accomplishments
3. **Generate Tailored Version** - Create a targeted version for a specific opportunity
4. **Full Workflow** - Walk through the complete resume building process

---

## Mode: Update Resume

1. Ask where the user's current resume lives (or start fresh)
2. Ask what they want to add or update
3. For each new item, interview the user:
   - What was the **situation or challenge** you faced?
   - What **actions** did you take?
   - What were the **results or impact**?
   - What **skills** did this demonstrate?
   - Can you **quantify** the outcome?
4. Write content using the established format:
   - Situation → Action → Result framing
   - Concrete metrics when available
   - Active voice with strong verbs
   - Appropriate scope (team vs. individual contribution)

---

## Mode: Gather Evidence

1. Ask what sources are available to scan
2. For each source type:

**Git Repositories:**
- Find commits by author and date range
- Identify tech stacks from config files
- Note architectural patterns and project scope
- Suggest bullet points based on contribution volume

**Documents & Files:**
- Read reports, proposals, or presentations the user points to
- Extract key accomplishments and outcomes mentioned
- Identify themes and areas of expertise

**Webpages & Published Work:**
- Fetch articles, portfolio pages, or company announcements
- Pull quotes, metrics, or recognition mentioned
- Note the reach or impact of published work

**Calendar (if accessible):**
- Identify recurring meetings the user led
- Find project kickoffs and completions
- Note cross-functional collaboration patterns

3. Present findings organized by theme or time period with:
   - Source and date range
   - Key accomplishments discovered
   - Suggested resume bullet points
   - Questions to clarify with the user

---

## Mode: Generate Tailored Version

1. Read the user's master resume or gathered content
2. Ask for the job description or target opportunity
3. Analyze which experiences are most relevant
4. Generate a condensed version that:
   - Leads with most relevant experience
   - Incorporates keywords from the opportunity naturally
   - Highlights transferable skills
   - Keeps the strongest metrics and achievements
   - Fits appropriate length (1-2 pages for most roles)
5. Output as clean markdown

---

## Mode: Full Workflow

Walk through the complete process:

1. **Profile Data** - Pull LinkedIn or existing resume as starting point
2. **Gather Evidence** - Scan available sources for accomplishments
3. **Interview** - Ask clarifying questions for each major item
4. **Draft** - Write initial resume content
5. **Iterate** - Present for corrections and refinements
6. **Finalize** - Structure into polished format

## Writing Style Guidelines

- **Active voice** with strong verbs (Led, Designed, Launched, Grew, Negotiated, Delivered)
- **Quantify impact** where possible (percentages, dollar amounts, user counts, time saved)
- **SAR format** — Situation, Action, Result
- **Scope clarity** — Distinguish solo ownership from team collaboration
- **Progression** — Show growth in responsibility and complexity over time
- **Relevance** — Prioritize accomplishments that demonstrate transferable value

## Verbs by Function

| Function | Strong Verbs |
|----------|--------------|
| Leadership | Led, Directed, Managed, Oversaw, Mentored, Championed |
| Creation | Built, Designed, Developed, Launched, Established, Pioneered |
| Growth | Grew, Increased, Expanded, Scaled, Accelerated, Doubled |
| Improvement | Improved, Optimized, Streamlined, Transformed, Modernized |
| Delivery | Delivered, Shipped, Completed, Executed, Achieved, Exceeded |
| Analysis | Analyzed, Identified, Evaluated, Assessed, Researched |
| Collaboration | Partnered, Coordinated, Collaborated, Unified, Aligned |
